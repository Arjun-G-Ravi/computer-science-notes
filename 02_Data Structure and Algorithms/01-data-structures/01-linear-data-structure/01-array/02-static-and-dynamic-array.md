# Static Array
A static array is a fixed-size data structure that allocates memory at compile time. It cannot be resized during runtime, meaning the size of the array must be known beforehand. Static arrays are typically used when the number of elements is constant and known in advance.
Eg: C/C++ arrays are static arrays that have a fixed size defined at compile time.

# Dynamic Array
A dynamic array is a resizable data structure that allocates memory at runtime. It can grow or shrink as needed, allowing for more flexibility compared to static arrays. Dynamic arrays are often implemented using a static array as the underlying storage, with additional logic to handle resizing (doubling in size) when the capacity is exceeded.
Eg: Python lists are dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink as needed.
