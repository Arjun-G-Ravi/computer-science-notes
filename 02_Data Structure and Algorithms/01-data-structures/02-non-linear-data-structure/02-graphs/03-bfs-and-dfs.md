# Depth First Search

It is a fundemental search/ traversal algorithm for graphs. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It has a time complexity of`O(V + E)` where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. It uses `stack` data structure for implementation, either explicitly or through recursion.

# Breadth First Search

It is another fundamental search/ traversal algorithm for graphs. It explores all the neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It has a time complexity of `O(V + E)` where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. It uses `queue` data structure for implementation.
